We have put all audios used in the experiments in a zip file.

[Download Link]: https://goo.gl/CJmrQh  (this is currently stored in Dr. Zeng's cse google account)

[Summary of the zip file]:
1. The zip file contains all adversarial and benign audio files used in experiments for AAAI workshop paper and DSN conference paper.

2. Host audios used for creating audio AEs are also included in the corresponding places inside "AE" directory.

3. CommanderSong AEs and recorded videos of their recognitions are placed in "AE/CommanderSong_AEs/" directory.

4. Structure of "AE" directory
	A.	35_WhiteBox_AE/: used only for AAAI workshop paper
		This directory contains 35 stress AEs generated by using Carlini's whitebox approach. These AEs were used as normal whitebox AEs when doing the experiment for AAAI workshop paper. The 35 stress AEs are splited into two parts, storing in "./test" and "./train" sub-directories. "test_filelist" and "train_filelist" list filenames inside "./test" and "./train" correspondingly.

		“similar_command_attack.csv” lists the host audio, host transcription, target phrase for each generated AE. Take the 2nd line in "similar_command_attack.cvs" for example.

			cv-valid-dev/sample-000037.wav,mine's in the door,open the door,

			[host audio]: sample-000037.wav from cv-valid-dev dataset in Common Voice dataset. The host audio file is not stored in this directory.
			[host transcription]: mine's in the door
			[target phrase]: open the door
			[AE filename]: sample-000037.wav

		For some audio file that will be used as a host more than once, like the 10th line in "similar_command_attack.cvs":
			cv-valid-test/sample-000024-2.wav,i'd like to think,I d like to sleep,2
			[host audio]: sample-000024.wav from cv-valid-test dataset in Common Voice dataset. The host audio file is not stored in this directory.
			[host transcription]: i'd like to think
			[target phrase]: I d like to sleep
			[AE filename]: sample-000024-2.wav

		[Host Audios] host audios were selected from cv-valid-dev, cv-valid-test and cv-valid-train datasets in Common Voice dataset.	
	
	B. 	100_BlackBox_AE/: used for both AAAI workshop paper and DSN paper
			This directory contains 100 AEs (inside the sub-directory, "audio_AEs") generated by using the black-box approach (Targeted Adversarial Examples for Black Box Audio Systems). The mapping of the host audio's filename and the target phrase for each AE are encoded in the AE's filename. Take "sample-000000_BB_AE_side_laugh.wav" for example.

				[host audio]: sample-000000.wav
				[target phrase]: side laugh

			Note: initially, filenames of these 100 black-box AE are as follows, "sample-XXXXXX_adv_<two words>.wav", which were used in experiments presented AAAI paper and DSN paper. The change from "adv" to "BB_AE" in filenames is to make them more readable for future use.

			[host audios]: First 100 audio files in Common Voice dataset, which are stored in the sub-directory, "100_host_audios_from_Common_Voice_dataset". "100-host-transcript.csv" gives the filename of each host audio and its transcription.

			[For AAAI workshop paper]: "test_filelist" and "train_filelist" are lists of AEs that were used for testing and training in the experiment presented in AAAI workshop paper.

	C. 	990_Nicolas_AE/: used for both AAAI workshop paper and DSN paper
		This director contains 990 white-box audio AEs offered by Nicholas Carlini (https://nicholas.carlini.com/). The descriptions of files and fold in this directory is as follows.
			1) Raw: The directory contains 990 white-box audio AEs from Nicholas Carlini
				for example, if an AE is named as "b_final0.3", then it was created by inserting the target phrase at the four line of "10_Target_Phrase" into the first of selected 100 Common Voice audio files, "sample-000000.wav".
			2) 100_host_voices_transcripts: first 100 audio files from Common Voice (https://voice.mozilla.org) and their corresponding transcriptions. These 100 were used by Nicholas Carlini as host audios to create his white-box AEs
			3) 10_Target_Phrases: 10 target phrases used by Nicholas Carnili to insert into host audios.    4) filelist: list of filenames for the 990 white-box AEs
			5) testSampleListFile.txt: list of AE files as part of AE testing set (For AAAI workshop paper)
			6) trainSampleListFile.txt: list of AE files as part of AE training set (For AAAI workshop paper)
			7) splitDataset.py: script to randomly select given number of audio files as testing set and the rest audio files as training set.
				usage: python splitDataset.py audioesDir filelist numberOfTestSamples testDir trainDir

	D. 	500_BlackBox_AE/: used only for DSN paper
		This directory contains 500 AEs generated by using the black-box approach (Targeted Adversarial Examples for Black Box Audio Systems). The 500 black-box AEs' filenames are listed in "500_BlackBox_AE_list", while the corresponding audio files are stored in the sub-directory "audio_AEs". Here, for each AE, a segment of an audio from LibriSpeech was used as the host, but not the entire audio. Because we found that even after 4000 iterations (2000 iterations are used in the paper), the black-box appraoch can not reach a decent edit distance between the target phrase and actually embeded phrase due that a LibriSpeech audio generally contains a large number of words.

		[Host audios]: we segmented multiple LibriSpeech audios into 61 segments. "./seg_LibriSpeech_host/segmentation.csv" tells the filename (without file extension) of each segment and its corresponding transcription. we selected 25 audio segments as the host audios that are placed in "./seg_LibriSpeech_host/25Hosts". While the rest audio segments are placed in "./seg_LibriSpeech_host/rest".

		[Target phrases]: 20 two-words phrases are chosen as the target phrases and stored in "./20_two_words_list"

		The mapping of host audio filename, target phrase and generated AE's filename is as follows, taking "BB_1320-122612-0000-1_T10.wav" for example, :
			the host audio filename is "1320-122612-0000-1.wav", the target phrase is the phrase at the 10th line of "./20_two_words_list".
	
	E. 	810_WhiteBox_AE/: used only for DSN paper
		This directory contains 810 white-box AEs generated by using Carnili's method (Audio Adversarial Examples: Targeted Attacks on Speech-to-Text). Initially, we aimed to generate 1000 AEs by using the 1000 audios from LibriSpeech dev_clean as the hosts and 1000 target phrases as listed in the file, "1000_target_sentences.txt". But for some cases, the generations failed to create AEs due to the convergence failure of Carlini's white-box approach. And further considering to meet the deadline of 2019 DSN conference, we finally created 810 white-box AEs.

		The mapping among host audio filename, injected target phrase and generated audio AE's filename is as follows, taking an audio AE file, "AE_30.wav", for example. The host audio filename is the one at the 30th line in "1000_host_filenames", the target phrase is at the 30th line in "1000_target_sentences.txt".
	
	F. 	CommanderSong_AEs/
		This directory contains 10 non-transferable CommanderSong AEs and 2 CommanderSong AEs that can transfer from Kaldi and DeepSpeech v0.1.0. The 10 non-transferable CommanderSong AEs are placed in the sub-directory, "5WTA_5WAA_AEs".
		
	G. 	50_Stress_Test_AE/ : not used in any reported experiment
		This directory contains 50 stress audio AEs generated by using Carlini's white-box approach. These AEs are not used in any experiment yet.

		"./50_stress_test.xlsx": each line (excluding the first line) describes the mapping of the host audio, host transcription and target phrase for an AE. Take the 2nd line for exapmle.    [host audio]: cv-valid-dev/sample-000167.mp3
			[host transcription]: the boy was relieved
			[target phrase]: the order was canceled
			[AE's filename]: sample-000167-1.mp3
	
5. Structure of "./Benign"
	A. 1125_LibriSpeech_dev_clean/: used for AAAI workshop paper
		these 1125 benign audios were randomly selected from dev_clean set (2703 audio files)

	B. 2400_LibriSpeech_dev_clean/: used for DSN paper
		these 2400 benign audios were randomly selected from dev_clean set (2703 audio files)
